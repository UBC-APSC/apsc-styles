## VSCode

APSC recommends using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your code editor.

The following extensions are recommended:

* [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) - Launch a local development server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages.
* [Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify) - Beautify your ugly code.
* [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - Quickly glimpse into whom, why, and when a line or code block was changed.
